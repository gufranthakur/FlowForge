FlowForge is a visual-based programming IDE (Similiar to Unreal Engine blueprints) that helps programmers create programs with drag and drop nodes. With a modern UI and simplistic approach towards visual programming, beginners can easily grasp and 
learn the logic building skills in programming.

(I created this for fun, but I am planning to flourish this out even more. I will be creating a game engine later on, so I will probably use this for scripting over there.)

# Features
* Drag and drop functionality for nodes
* Simulate and run programs within the IDE 
* Basic Functions: Print, Branch, Input, Delay, Loop, and Conditional-Loop.
