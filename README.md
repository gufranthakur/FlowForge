FlowForge is a visual-based programming IDE (Similiar to Unreal Engine blueprints) that helps programmers create programs with drag and drop nodes. With a modern UI and simplistic approach. It's a toy Visual programming language I created for fun, but if I ever create a game engine in the future, I will definetely use this for the scripting :)

# Features
* Drag and drop functionality for nodes
* Simulate and run programs within the IDE 
* Basic Functions: Print, Branch, Input, Delay, Loop, and Conditional-Loop.
* Arithmetic Operations, Comparators and Logic Gates
* Step-by-step execution mode for debugging
